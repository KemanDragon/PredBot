The rule of thumb is this. Discord has two nullable components.

#1: Field
#2: Type

If the *field* is nullable, that means that the object flat out might not be sent in json.
	> The C# field should be nullable and use NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore

If the *type* is nullable, that means the object is sent, but explicitly as null.
	> The C# field should be nullable, and nothing more.
	> REMEMBER TO SET THE DEFAULT VALUE OF THESE PROPERTIES IF NEEDED!!! 
	> ^ Will it be read anyway and be easier if it already had a value e.g. a bool value of false instead of null?
	> ^ **Is it contextually ambiguous?** Does "false" carry a different meaning than it not existing, for instance?

If the field *and* type are nullable, it should use the same style as field
